/// ## What it does
/// Checks for f-strings that do not contain any placeholder expressions.
///
/// ## Why is this bad?
/// f-strings are a convenient way to format strings, but they are not
/// necessary if there are no placeholder expressions to format. In this
/// case, a regular string should be used instead, as an f-string without
/// placeholders can be confusing for readers, who may expect such a
/// placeholder to be present.
///
/// An f-string without any placeholders could also indicate that the
/// author forgot to add a placeholder expression.
///
/// ## Example
/// ```python
/// f"Hello, world!"
/// ```
///
/// Use instead:
/// ```python
/// "Hello, world!"
/// ```
///
/// **Note:** to maintain compatibility with PyFlakes, this rule only flags
/// f-strings that are part of an implicit concatenation if _none_ of the
/// f-string segments contain placeholder expressions.
///
/// For example:
///
/// ```python
/// # Will not be flagged.
/// (
///     f"Hello,"
///     f" {name}!"
/// )
///
/// # Will be flagged.
/// (
///     f"Hello,"
///     f" World!"
/// )
/// ```
