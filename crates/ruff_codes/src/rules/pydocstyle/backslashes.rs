/// ## What it does
/// Checks for docstrings that include backslashes, but are not defined as
/// raw string literals.
///
/// ## Why is this bad?
/// In Python, backslashes are typically used to escape characters in strings.
/// In raw strings (those prefixed with an `r`), however, backslashes are
/// treated as literal characters.
///
/// [PEP 257](https://peps.python.org/pep-0257/#what-is-a-docstring) recommends
/// the use of raw strings (i.e., `r"""raw triple double quotes"""`) for
/// docstrings that include backslashes. The use of a raw string ensures that
/// any backslashes are treated as literal characters, and not as escape
/// sequences, which avoids confusion.
///
/// ## Example
/// ```python
/// def foobar():
///     """Docstring for foo\bar."""
///
///
/// foobar.__doc__  # "Docstring for foar."
/// ```
///
/// Use instead:
/// ```python
/// def foobar():
///     r"""Docstring for foo\bar."""
///
///
/// foobar.__doc__  # "Docstring for foo\bar."
/// ```
///
