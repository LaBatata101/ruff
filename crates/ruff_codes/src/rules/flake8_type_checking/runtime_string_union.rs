/// ## What it does
/// Checks for the presence of string literals in `X | Y`-style union types.
///
/// ## Why is this bad?
/// [PEP 604] introduced a new syntax for union type annotations based on the
/// `|` operator.
///
/// While Python's type annotations can typically be wrapped in strings to
/// avoid runtime evaluation, the use of a string member within an `X | Y`-style
/// union type will cause a runtime error.
///
/// Instead, remove the quotes, wrap the _entire_ union in quotes, or use
/// `from __future__ import annotations` to disable runtime evaluation of
/// annotations entirely.
///
/// ## Example
/// ```python
/// var: str | "int"
/// ```
///
/// Use instead:
/// ```python
/// var: str | int
/// ```
///
/// Or, extend the quotes to include the entire union:
/// ```python
/// var: "str | int"
/// ```
///
