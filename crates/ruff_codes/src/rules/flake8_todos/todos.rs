/// ## What it does
/// Checks that a TODO comment is labelled with "TODO".
///
/// ## Why is this bad?
/// Ambiguous tags reduce code visibility and can lead to dangling TODOs.
/// For example, if a comment is tagged with "FIXME" rather than "TODO", it may
/// be overlooked by future readers.
///
/// Note that this rule will only flag "FIXME" and "XXX" tags as incorrect.
///
/// ## Example
/// ```python
/// # FIXME(ruff): this should get fixed!
/// ```
///
/// Use instead:
/// ```python
/// # TODO(ruff): this is now fixed!
/// ```

/// ## Why is this bad?

/// # TODO: should assign an author here

/// # TODO(charlie): now an author is assigned
