/// ## What it does
/// Checks for duplicate union members.
///
/// ## Why is this bad?
/// Duplicate union members are redundant and should be removed.
///
/// ## Example
/// ```python
/// foo: str | str
/// ```
///
/// Use instead:
/// ```python
/// foo: str
/// ```
///
/// ## Fix safety
/// This rule's fix is marked as safe unless the union contains comments.
///
/// For nested union, the fix will flatten type expressions into a single
/// top-level union.
///
/// ## References
/// - [Python documentation: `typing.Union`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.Union)
