/// ## What it does
/// Checks for parameter annotations that contain redundant unions between
/// builtin numeric types (e.g., `int | float`).
///
/// ## Why is this bad?
/// The [typing specification] states:
///
/// > Pythonâ€™s numeric types `complex`, `float` and `int` are not subtypes of
/// > each other, but to support common use cases, the type system contains a
/// > straightforward shortcut: when an argument is annotated as having type
/// > `float`, an argument of type `int` is acceptable; similar, for an
/// > argument annotated as having type `complex`, arguments of type `float` or
/// > `int` are acceptable.
///
/// As such, a union that includes both `int` and `float` is redundant in the
/// specific context of a parameter annotation, as it is equivalent to a union
/// that only includes `float`. For readability and clarity, unions should omit
/// redundant elements.
///
/// ## Example
///
/// ```pyi
/// def foo(x: float | int | str) -> None: ...
/// ```
///
/// Use instead:
///
/// ```pyi
/// def foo(x: float | str) -> None: ...
/// ```
///
/// ## Fix safety
/// This rule's fix is marked as safe, unless the type annotation contains comments.
///
/// Note that while the fix may flatten nested unions into a single top-level union,
/// the semantics of the annotation will remain unchanged.
