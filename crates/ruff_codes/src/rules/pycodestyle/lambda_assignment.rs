/// ## What it does
/// Checks for lambda expressions which are assigned to a variable.
///
/// ## Why is this bad?
/// Per PEP 8, you should "Always use a def statement instead of an assignment
/// statement that binds a lambda expression directly to an identifier."
///
/// Using a `def` statement leads to better tracebacks, and the assignment
/// itself negates the primary benefit of using a `lambda` expression (i.e.,
/// that it can be embedded inside another expression).
///
/// ## Example
/// ```python
/// f = lambda x: 2 * x
/// ```
///
/// Use instead:
/// ```python
/// def f(x):
///     return 2 * x
/// ```
///
/// [PEP 8]: https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/#programming-recommendations
