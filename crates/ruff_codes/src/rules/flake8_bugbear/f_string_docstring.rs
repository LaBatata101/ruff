/// ## What it does
/// Checks for docstrings that are written via f-strings.
///
/// ## Why is this bad?
/// Python will interpret the f-string as a joined string, rather than as a
/// docstring. As such, the "docstring" will not be accessible via the
/// `__doc__` attribute, nor will it be picked up by any automated
/// documentation tooling.
///
/// ## Example
/// ```python
/// def foo():
///     f"""Not a docstring."""
/// ```
///
/// Use instead:
/// ```python
/// def foo():
///     """A docstring."""
/// ```
///
