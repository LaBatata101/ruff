/// ## What it does
/// Checks for the presence of unnecessary quotes in type annotations.
///
/// ## Why is this bad?
/// In Python, type annotations can be quoted to avoid forward references.
///
/// However, if `from __future__ import annotations` is present, Python
/// will always evaluate type annotations in a deferred manner, making
/// the quotes unnecessary.
///
/// Similarly, if the annotation is located in a typing-only context and
/// won't be evaluated by Python at runtime, the quotes will also be
/// considered unnecessary. For example, Python does not evaluate type
/// annotations on assignments in function bodies.
///
/// ## Example
///
/// Given:
///
/// ```python
/// from __future__ import annotations
///
///
/// def foo(bar: "Bar") -> "Bar": ...
/// ```
///
/// Use instead:
///
/// ```python
/// from __future__ import annotations
///
///
/// def foo(bar: Bar) -> Bar: ...
/// ```
///
/// Given:
///
/// ```python
/// def foo() -> None:
///     bar: "Bar"
/// ```
///
/// Use instead:
///
/// ```python
/// def foo() -> None:
///     bar: Bar
/// ```
///

/// - [`quoted-annotation-in-stub`][PYI020]: A rule that
///   removes all quoted annotations from stub files
/// - [`quoted-type-alias`][TC008]: A rule that removes unnecessary quotes
///   from type aliases.
