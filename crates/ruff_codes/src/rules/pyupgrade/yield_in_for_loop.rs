/// ## What it does
/// Checks for `for` loops that can be replaced with `yield from` expressions.
///
/// ## Why is this bad?
/// If a `for` loop only contains a `yield` statement, it can be replaced with a
/// `yield from` expression, which is more concise and idiomatic.
///
/// ## Example
/// ```python
/// for x in foo:
///     yield x
///
/// global y
/// for y in foo:
///     yield y
/// ```
///
/// Use instead:
/// ```python
/// yield from foo
///
/// for _element in foo:
///     y = _element
///     yield y
/// ```
///
/// ## Fix safety
/// This rule's fix is marked as unsafe, as converting a `for` loop to a `yield
/// from` expression can change the behavior of the program in rare cases.
/// For example, if a generator is being sent values via `send`, then rewriting
/// to a `yield from` could lead to an attribute error if the underlying
/// generator does not implement the `send` method.
///
/// Additionally, if at least one target is `global` or `nonlocal`,
/// no fix will be offered.
///
/// In most cases, however, the fix is safe, and such a modification should have
/// no effect on the behavior of the program.
