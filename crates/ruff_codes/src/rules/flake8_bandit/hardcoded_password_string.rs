/// ## What it does
/// Checks for potential uses of hardcoded passwords in strings.
///
/// ## Why is this bad?
/// Including a hardcoded password in source code is a security risk, as an
/// attacker could discover the password and use it to gain unauthorized
/// access.
///
/// Instead, store passwords and other secrets in configuration files,
/// environment variables, or other sources that are excluded from version
/// control.
///
/// ## Example
/// ```python
/// SECRET_KEY = "hunter2"
/// ```
///
/// Use instead:
/// ```python
/// import os
///
/// SECRET_KEY = os.environ["SECRET_KEY"]
/// ```
///
/// ## References
/// - [Common Weakness Enumeration: CWE-259](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/259.html)
